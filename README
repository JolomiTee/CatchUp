# Tailwindcss Starter template for future projects

I structured this based on how i would want my folder structure to look like, so it may or may not be ideal to some.
Feel free to make your changes to the folder structure, add your ```npm run``` commands, and install your favourite plugins.

Steps to get started:

* Clone, Fork or Download the repo from github
* Open in your favourite Code Editor (VSCode *wink)
* Open your command line or terminal, with the ```My custom template``` folder being the current directory
* Use the command ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies that comes with the template
* Since its custom, it has a custom command to get Tailwind and Postcss doing their jobs, run ```npm run pcss`` (pcss for postcss *wink)
It should have your base utilities ready for you.
Then,  run ```npm dev build``` to host locally in nyour browser.

Enjoy!!!
