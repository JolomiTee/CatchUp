# CatchUp

## Election break projects

CatchUp is a working landing page designed by Ogunya Marvelous, and developed into a website by me as part our ji=oint effort in pushing each other further on our learning, development and designing paths

Steps to get started:

* Clone, Fork or Download the repo from github
* Open in your favourite Code Editor (VSCode *wink)
* Open your command line or terminal, with the ```CatchUp``` folder being the current directory
* Use the command ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies that comes with the template
* Since its custom, it has a custom command to get Tailwind and Postcss doing their jobs, run ```npm run pcss`` (pcss for postcss *wink)

It should have your base utilities ready for you.
Then, run ```npm dev build``` to host locally in your browser.

Enjoy!!!
